# Breaking Bapp
Flutter app that consumes the [Breaking Bad API](https://breakingbadapi.com), which provides us with a collection of information on the Breaking Bad and Better Call Saul TV Shows. Our app, though, is restricted to Breaking Bad characters and its remarkable quotes.

This repository is the sample for some in-depth articles on Flutter (work in progress). I'll add them here as they're live:

1. [Spotless Routing and Navigation](https://edsonbueno.com/2020/02/26/spotless-routing-and-navigation-in-flutter/)
2. [Bringing onResume/viewDidAppear onPause/viewDidDisappear to Flutter](https://edsonbueno.com/2020/03/19/bringing-on-resume-view-did-appear-to-flutter/)
